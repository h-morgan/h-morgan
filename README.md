Hi, I'm Haley :wave:

I'm a backend software engineer with experience across growth startups, large enterprises, and freelance clients. I specialize in building and maintaining APIs, data pipelines, and AWS infrastructure - particularly around financial, HR, and healthcare data processing.

I enjoy tackling complex data challenges and working closely with cross-functional teams to solve technical problems. I enjoy learning new technologies and looking for opportunities to work on systems where reliable data processing really matters. Some of my personal projects exploring backend and data engineering are showcased here.

If you have any questions or want to get in touch:
